            "data": "\nThis idea of being sculpturesque, statuesque, while also keeping in back of your mind that you die, is this idea of dying a heroic death, a tragically beautiful death, having a tragically beautiful body, and a tragically beautiful mind. I aspire to beauty not because a beauty is an ideal to be reached, but it's an ideal to be had. And in fact, we are made of muscle. The human body has over 600 skeletal muscles that account for over half of our body weight. If that is the case, then we're losing half of our beauty by not attending to our muscular structure.\n",

                    "text": "What difference there might be resolves itself into the presence or absence of the idea of honor, which regards death as \"something to be seen,\" and the presence or absence of the formal aesthetic of death that goes with it\u2014in other words, the tragic nature of the approach to death and the beauty of the body going to its doom. Thus, where a beautiful death is concerned, men are condemned to inequalities and degrees of fortune commensurate with the inequalities and degrees of fortune bestowed on them by fate at their birth\u2014though this inequality is obscured nowadays by the fact that modern man is almost devoid of the desire of the ancient Greeks to live \"beautifully\" and die \"beautifully.\" Why should a man be associated with beauty only through a heroic, violent death? In ordinary life, society maintains a careful surveillance to ensure that men shall have no part in beauty; physical beauty in the male, when considered as an \"object\" in itself without any intermediate agent, is despised, and the profession of the male actor\u2014which involves constantly being \"seen\"\u2014is far from being accorded true respect. A strict rule is imposed where men are concerned. It is this: a man must under normal circumstances never permit his own objectivization; he can only be objectified through the supreme action\u2014which is, I suppose, the moment of death, the moment when, even without being seen, the fiction of being seen and the beauty of the object are permitted. Of such is the beauty of the suicide squad, which is recognized as beauty not only in the spiritual sense but, by men in general, in an ultra-erotic sense also. Moreover, serving as agent in this case is a heroic action of an intensity beyond the resources of the ordinary mortal, so that \"objectivization\" without an agent is not possible here. However close mere words may get to this moment of supreme action that acts as intermediary for beauty, they can no more overtake it than a flying body can attain the speed of light.",

At the same time, by showing us symbolically the limits of spatiality in the art of sculpture, it intimates that nothing but decline lies beyond the greatest human glory. The sculptor, in his arrogance, has sought to capture life only at its supreme moment. If the solemnity and dignity of the body arise solely from the element of mortality that lurks within it, then the road that leads to death, I reasoned, must have some private path connecting with pain, suffering, and the continuing consciousness that is proof of life.",
