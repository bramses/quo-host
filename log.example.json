Thus, where a beautiful death is concerned, men are condemned to inequalities and degrees of fortune commensurate with the inequalities and degrees of fortune bestowed on them by fate at their birth—though this inequality is obscured nowadays by the fact that modern man is almost devoid of the desire of the ancient Greeks to live \"beautifully\" and die \"beautifully.\" Why should a man be associated with beauty only through a heroic, violent death? In ordinary life, society maintains a careful surveillance to ensure that men shall have no part in beauty; physical beauty in the male, when considered as an \"object\" in itself without any intermediate agent, is despised, and the profession of the male actor—which involves constantly being \"seen\"—is far from being accorded true respect. A strict rule is imposed where men are concerned. It is this: a man must under normal circumstances never permit his own objectivization; he can only be objectified through the supreme action—which is, I suppose, the moment of death, the moment when, even without being seen, the fiction of being seen and the beauty of the object are permitted. Of such is the beauty of the suicide squad, which is recognized as beauty not only in the spiritual sense but, by men in general, in an ultra-erotic sense also. Moreover, serving as agent in this case is a heroic action of an intensity beyond the resources of the ordinary mortal, so that \"objectivization\" without an agent is not possible here. However close mere words may get to this moment of supreme action that acts as intermediary for beauty, they can no more overtake it than a flying body can attain the speed of light.",

                      "text": "In 1996 the psychologist Amos Tversky learned that he was dying of metastatic melanoma. He carried on his normal routine, and most of those who encountered him were oblivious to his condition. He died not long afterward, at age fifty-nine. During a discussion of his impending death, he told a friend: “Life is a book. The fact that it was a short book doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good book. It was a very good book.”1 Although Tversky died a natural death, he had obtained drugs that would allow him to end his life quickly and painlessly, if he chose to do so. The ancient Stoics would have understood this choice. They thought that under some circumstances, suicide wasn’t just morally acceptable; it was sensible. Seneca, for example, imagined God explaining his thinking to us: “I have made nothing easier than dying. I placed life on a downward slope: if it is prolonged, only observe and you will see how short, how easy is the path that leads to freedom.”2 Dying, then, is the easy part of your Stoic exit exam; the challenge is to retain your equanimity. I should add that as long as your continued existence can help others, Stoics would regard it as cowardly to commit suicide.",

The prospect of our own extinction may draw us towards that way of life on which our hearts place the greatest value. This theme animates “To His Coy Mistress” (1681), Andrew Marvell’s famous poetic attempt to lure a hesitant young woman into bed, through lines that stress not only her beauty and his fidelity but also the less obviously romantic notion that both she and he will soon enough be stone dead.",
